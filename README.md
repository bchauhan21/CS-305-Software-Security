•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirements, investments, and insurance for their patrons. They desire to modernize their software and its operations by incorporating the most current and effective software security.
•	What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
To identify their software security vulnerabilities, I have run the dependency check report. I then added proper checksum file verification to ensure file integrity.
•	What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
The most challenging part while working through the vulnerability assessment was documenting all the existing vulnerability.
•	How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
It is important to understand what type of industry the application is operating in. Financial applications like the one Artemis Financial uses, will be more prone to attacks. Keeping that in mind, we can decide the amount of security layers to add to their application.
•	How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure that the code and software application were functional and secure, I would run the dependency check report and find out if there is any vulnerability there. Any vulnerability found will be suppressed. Later, the refactored code then run the dependency check report after suppression. This way, I can ensure that the application runs securely.
•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The use of dependency check tool will assist in implementing secure dependencies into a project.
•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I would like to showcase my skills and knowledge to understand the requirements, assess security vulnerabilities, and implement proper mitigating solutions.
